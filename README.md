## Project Overview

Calc is an advanced mathematical calculator that allows users to write mathematical expressions by hand using ink strokes and solves complex mathematical operations in real-time. Currently, the app focuses on solving simple arithmetic, algebraic equations, and complex calculus problems. Future updates will support solving diagrams and more advanced questions.

## Features

- **Handwriting Recognition**: Converts ink strokes into digital mathematical expressions.
- **Real-Time Calculation**: Instantly solves math problems as they are written.
- **Complex Math Support**: Handles algebraic equations, calculus operations, integrals, and derivatives.
- **Clean UI**: Designed for an iPad-like experience, offering a simple and intuitive interface.

## How It Works

1. **Ink Input**: Users write math expressions on the app interface using a stylus or finger.
2. **Recognition**: The app uses machine learning models to recognize handwritten math symbols and equations.
3. **Computation**: Once recognized, the app calculates the result using advanced math libraries and displays the solution in real-time.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.x**
- **TensorFlow or PyTorch** (for handwriting recognition)
- **Matplotlib/MathJax** (for rendering math equations)

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/calc.git
